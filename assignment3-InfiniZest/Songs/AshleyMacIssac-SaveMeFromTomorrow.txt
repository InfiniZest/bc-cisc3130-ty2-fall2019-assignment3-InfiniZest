Deeper than the deepest deep blue sea
High as a girl in a redwood tree
Lonesome as a cowboy on TV
That's what it feels like to be me

Hey Ho I wanna let go
To everybody I ever did know
Swing your partner, dosey do
Save me from tomorrow
Ba ba ba ba ba ba...

Swinging like a rope on a southern breeze
Shaking like a pilgrim beyond belief
Falling like an angel, endlessly
That's what it feels like to be me
That's what it feels like to be me

Hey Ho I wanna let go
To everybody I ever did know
Swing your partner, dosey do
Save me from tomorrow
Ba ba ba ba ba ba...

Hey Ho I wanna let go
To everybody I ever did know
Swing your partner, dosey do
Save me from tomorrow
Ba ba ba ba ba ba..
